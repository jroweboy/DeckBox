DeckBox
=======

A tool for card game enthusiasts to build and play test decks straight from a smart phone.

The main purpose of this is so I can learn Haxe and see if its something that I can recommend to others and 
in the process, learn some new skills. With any luck it'll just work on all the different platforms. With bad 
luck it'll be write once, rewrite several times.
